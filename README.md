Overview
This repository contains my portfolio submission for CS 255: Systems Analysis and Design. It includes key documents from Project One and Project Two, showcasing my skills in system analysis and design.

Contents
Business Requirements Document: From Project One, outlining the functional and non-functional requirements for the DriverPass system.
System Design Document: From Project Two, detailing system workflows, UML diagrams, and technical requirements.
Reflection: Answers to questions about my work on these projects and insights gained.
Reflection
1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project.
The DriverPass project was developed for a driving school to provide an online system for making, modifying, and canceling reservations. It also includes tools for internal staff to manage roles, permissions, and reports.

2. What did you do well?
I created clear UML diagrams that effectively represented the system's workflows and requirements.

3. What would you revise, and why?
I would revise the technical requirements section to include more detail on third-party tool integrations, like payment gateways, and add mock-up diagrams for clarity.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is this important?
Through client interviews, I identified key priorities such as ease of use, security, and efficiency. These needs were incorporated into features like the reservation workflow and role-based access control. Meeting user needs ensures the system is functional and aligns with the client’s goals.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future?
My approach involves gathering detailed requirements, creating workflows, and focusing on security and scalability. In the future, I would use interactive prototypes and iterative processes to refine designs.
